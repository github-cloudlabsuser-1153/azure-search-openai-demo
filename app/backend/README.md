As an AI, I don't have direct access to your file system or the ability to read files. However, I can explain what a `requirements.txt` file is and how it's used in Python projects.

A `requirements.txt` file is a file that lists all of the Python package dependencies a Python application needs to run. Each line of the file includes a package name and optionally a version number. Here's an example:

```plaintext
numpy==1.18.1
pandas>=1.0.1
scikit-learn
```

In this example, the application requires `numpy` version 1.18.1, `pandas` version 1.0.1 or later, and any version of `scikit-learn`.

You can generate a `requirements.txt` file for your current environment using the command `pip freeze > requirements.txt` in your terminal. This will create a `requirements.txt` file with all the packages in your current environment.

To install the packages listed in a `requirements.txt` file, you can use the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
